Eagle schematic capture/pcb projects:

Currently active:
    (iv4_4lw_1.2.2_usb_nodiscrete)  IV-4 based four-letter-word clock gadget thingy.  Now runs on DC and has a USB port for some ungodly reason.
                                    This project currently lacks a BOM, and is pretty technically challenging to solder yourself.  As I revise
                                    the layout, I'll add the necessary information to get things built yourself, as well as relaxing the board
                                    layout itself.

                                    The verbose name indicates that it it's version 1.2.2 (duh), has usb (duh duh), and does not use discrete grid
                                    drivers for the IV4 tubes, as previous iterations did.

    (iv4_6lw_1.0_usb)               A pipe dream for right now.  Similar to the above project, but with 6 letters instead of 4.  My version of
                                    EAGLE isn't capable enough to design boards of the needed size, so unless I get creatie this isn't going to
                                    happen any time soon.

    (minixie)                       NL-5440/A clock/display project.  Currently languishing, but I refuse to retire it.
